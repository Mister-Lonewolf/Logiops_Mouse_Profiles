## Device Features Overview

| Device                         | Documentation Link                  |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Wireless Mobile Mouse MX Anywhere 2 | [docs/mx_anywhere_2.md](docs/mx_anywhere_2.md) |

## Config File Location

Logiops looks for its configuration at:

```
/etc/logid.cfg
```

To use this config, copy `logid.cfg` from this repository into that location (with root permissions):

```bash
sudo cp logid.cfg /etc/logid.cfg
```

Then restart the Logiops service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart logid
```


## Fixing Missing Service

If `systemctl status logiops` gives:

```
Unit logiops.service could not be found
```

Then the systemd service file wasn't installed or registered. You can create it manually:

### Create the Service File

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/logiops.service
```

Paste this:

```
[Unit]
Description=Logitech HID++ userspace daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/logid
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> Adjust `ExecStart` if `which logid` gives a different path.

Then enable and start it:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now logiops
```

Now Logiops will run on boot, and your MX Verticalâ€™s top button should work consistently.

## Requirements

- Linux system with `systemd`
- `logid` daemon running (via Logiops)
- Appropriate udev permissions (see [Logiops repo](https://github.com/PixlOne/logiops#permissions) if needed)
